# GT_simulations
This repository contains simulations and analytical tools designed for game-theoretic modeling and probabilistic strategy analysis, specifically focusing on turn-based competitions between two playersâ€”Alice and Bob. The simulations explore various aspects of strategic interaction, including optimal decision-making, payoff matrix evolution, and expectation/variance computations.
